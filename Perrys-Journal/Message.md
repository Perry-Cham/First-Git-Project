Hello Natalie. Here's the solution to the task you sent me(I think?)

-WHAT I HAVE LEARNED TODAY?
1. Github is collaborative platform where developers can work on different parts of a project at the same time. 
2. Issues are like tasks that need to be done on the thing we're working on and each developer can make a branch to work on that task. 
3. When we branch out from the issue we write our code and when we're done we run git status to find out what has changed. The we can accept the changes run git commit to save the progress and finally run git push to push the changes to the repository.
4. Then we go back to github and start a pull request to merge our issue branch with the main branch.
5. When the pull request is accepted and github finds out the new code isn't too different from the old code the branches are merged.


Well I think I got everything. Git is interesting! Just like when I started learning javascript. Can't wait for tomorrow's lesson

Well I guess this is goodbye for now. 
So goodmorning/afternoon/Evening 
A greeting for whatever time you see this!
