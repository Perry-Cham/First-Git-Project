# First-Git-Project

Hello from Krakow in Poland to Zamibia

How are you doing?

You need to run `git pull`
Then you make changes to the file
Then you run `git add -p`
Confirm your choice with `y`
Commit your changes with `git commit -m"[TASK] your commit message"`
Sent the changes to the repository with `git push`
Then send me a message on Facebook :-)

Have fun!! :-)
