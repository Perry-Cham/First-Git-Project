# First-Git-Project

Hello from Krakow in Poland to Zamibia

How are you doing?

-   You need to run `git pull`
-   Then you make changes to the file
-   Then you run `git add -p`
-   Confirm your choice with `y`
-   Commit your changes with `git commit -m"[TASK] your commit message"`
-   Sent the changes to the repository with `git push`
-   Then send me a message on Facebook :-)

-   Have fun!! :-)
